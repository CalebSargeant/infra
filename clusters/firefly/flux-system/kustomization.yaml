  # Add your different flux components here, like different kustomizations & gitrepositories, for flux to reconcile:
  - gitrepo-public-apps.yaml
  - gitrepo-private-apps.yaml

# The above apps.yaml is a kustomization that points to the apps directory in the monolithic-deploy repo.
# You can add one yaml file per repo that you want flux to reconcile - say one repo per team or per application.
# In our case, we've got the flux-system components and all of our apps that we want to add to our k3s cluster, seperated into different directories.
# The flux-system folder contains the flux-system namespace and the flux components (flux itself on the cluster).
