# fortigate

Manages two **standalone FortiGate 40Fs** (no HA) as resilient dual-ISP edges.
The `fortinetdev/fortios` provider is iterated per unit with **`for_each`**
(OpenTofu 1.9+), so each resource below is declared once and applied to both
boxes at the same time — the same pattern as `oci/modules/mikrotik`.

## Topology modelled

```
        ISP1                                   ISP2
         │                                      │
       (wan)                                  (wan)
      ┌──────┐   interconnect /30   ┌──────┐
      │ FGT1 │◀────────────────────▶│ FGT2 │
      └──────┘                       └──────┘
       │    └────crosslink───┐    ┌───crosslink────┘   │
   (lan_mikrotik)            │    │             (lan_mikrotik)
       │                     ▼    ▼                     │
   ┌─────────┐            ┌─────────┐            ┌─────────┐
   │MikroTik1│◀──────────▶│  ...    │◀──────────▶│MikroTik2│
   └─────────┘  MT<->MT   └─────────┘            └─────────┘
```

- Each FortiGate has its own ISP on `wan` (DHCP by default).
- `interconnect` — direct FGT1↔FGT2 link (/30).
- `lan_mikrotik` — link to the MikroTik directly behind each unit (clients live
  behind the MikroTik; the FortiGate is their gateway + DHCP server).
- `crosslink` — link to the **opposite** unit's MikroTik (FGT1↔MikroTik2,
  FGT2↔MikroTik1) for a redundant fabric path.
- `lan_mikrotik` + `crosslink` are grouped into the `internal` zone.

MikroTik2 isn't installed yet — its FGT2 `lan_mikrotik` and the cross-links can
be configured ahead of cabling; the interfaces simply sit link-down until wired.
The MikroTik side itself is out of scope here (see `oci/modules/mikrotik` for
the routeros pattern when you add it).

## What it configures, per unit

Interfaces (wan/interconnect/lan/crosslink) · `internal` zone · LAN DHCP server ·
4 firewall policies (internal→wan SNAT, internal↔interconnect east-west,
interconnect→wan ISP-failover egress) · east-west static route to the peer LAN ·
backup default route via the interconnect for ISP failover.

## ⚠️ Before you apply

1. **Verify physical port names.** Defaults are `wan` + `internal1..3`. The 40F's
   4 internal ports ship as one hardware switch — confirm the real per-port
   interface names on each unit (`get system interface physical`) and remap via
   each FortiGate's `ports = { ... }` in the leaf if they differ. An interface
   that's a hardware-switch member can't take its own IP until it's split out.
2. **Placeholder addressing.** All IPs in `prod/terragrunt.hcl` are RFC1918
   placeholders — set your real scheme.
3. **Tokens + reachability.** Create a REST-API admin token per unit
   (`config system api-user`), store each in OCI Vault, and wire them in (see
   the leaf's credentials comment). The host running `terragrunt apply` (incl.
   Atlantis on firefly) must be able to reach each FortiGate's mgmt IP/API.

Until 1–3 are done, the Atlantis project for this leaf is left with
`autoplan.enabled: false` (a plan can't reach a device that isn't there yet);
run it manually with `atlantis plan -p fortigate-prod`.
